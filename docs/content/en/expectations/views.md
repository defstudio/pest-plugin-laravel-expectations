### `toBeView()`

Assert that the value is an instance of \Illuminate\View\View with the given name.

```php
expect(view('page'))->toBeView('page');
 ```

It can optionally check that the array was given to the view.
```php
expect(view('page')->with('data', 'foo'))->toBeView('page', ['data' => 42]);
 ```
